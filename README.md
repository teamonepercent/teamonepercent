Corey, or more commonly known as “Crypto” Corey, started his professional career as a financial analyst for one of the top 4 financial institutions in the US. Shortly after, Corey realized his entrepreneurial perspective transcended finance, leading him to retire from the corporate environment and pursue opportunities to better leverage his innate leadership qualities and passion for team building.

When bitcoin emerged as an attractive portfolio investment, Corey understood the revolutionary impact this would have on international payment platforms and commerce. In under a year, Corey leveraged a low 5-figure investment into multiple 7 figures as he successfully capitalized on the market trends and volatility of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other “alternative” coins.

Corey’s drive for financial independence and his appreciation for transformative technology inevitably led Corey into the world of crypto. Since then, Corey has worked as an independent affiliate and built organizations over 3.2 million members across 23 countries. Corey’s success in this space has allowed him to build a large network in China where he now manages a global hedge fund based out of Hong Kong. As a consultative advisor, he’s helped over 20,000 of his students make educated trades and consistent returns on their investments.
